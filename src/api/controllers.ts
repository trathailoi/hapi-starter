/**
 * This class is automatically generated from swagger.  It is safe to overwrite an existing file with this one.
 *
 * The purpose of this class is to simply collect all of our controllers so we can generate
 * routes for them in one place.
 *
 * Each controller we create should extend HapiController - this hooks that controller into
 * a scheme for tracking the controllers and adding operations common to all of the controllers.
 *
 * For every controller, there should be a private instance of that controller injected into
 * this class.  Behind the scenes, HapiController will evaluate the class for @HapiRoute
 * annotations and create HAPI route configurations for each annotated method.
